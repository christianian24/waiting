## ðŸš€ Installation & Setup

Since this is a client-side-only project, setup is simple.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/christianian24/waiting.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

3.  **Open the file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

    > **Note:** For the best experience (especially with audio playback), it's recommended to serve the file through a local web server, but opening it directly will also work.

## ðŸ”§ Customization Guide

You can easily personalize this project by editing the `index.html` file.

### 1. Target Date

Change the countdown's target date by modifying the `COUNTDOWN_TARGET_DATE` constant. The format is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+TIMEZONE`.

```html
<!-- In the first <script> block -->
<script>
    const COUNTDOWN_TARGET_DATE = new Date("2031-05-26T15:34:00+08:00");
    // ...
</script>
```

### 2. Background Image

Update the background by changing the `background-image` URL in the CSS `<style>` block. Place your image in the `img/` folder for consistency.

```css
/* In the <style> block */
body {
    background-image: url('img\1.jpg');
    /* ... */
}
```

### 3. Avatar / Logo

Change the avatar by updating the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag with the `id="logo"`.

```html
<!-- Inside the <body> tag -->
<img src="https://media.tenor.com/YX7uvNo4bgEAAAAi/peach-goma-peach-and-goma.gif" id="logo" alt="Avatar">
```

### 4. Background Music

Replace the music file by changing the `src` attribute in the `<audio>` tag at the bottom of the file. Place your audio file in the `mp3/` folder.

```html
<!-- At the end of the <body> -->
<audio loop="loop" id="background_music">
    <source src="mp3/your-new-song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>
```

### 5. Animation Text Sequence

Modify the text displayed by the particle animation by editing the string inside the `S.UI.simulate()` function call.

- Use a pipe `|` to separate different messages/frames.
- Use special commands like `#countdown 3` to create a numbered countdown within the animation.
- The `#livecountdown` command will display the remaining years, days, hours, and minutes.

```javascript
<script>
    var S = {
        init: function () {
            // ...
            S.UI.simulate("First Message|Second Message|#countdown 3|Final Message|#livecountdown");
            // ...
        }
    };
    // ...
</script>
```
